{% hint style="success" %}
#### NFT-Proland is focused on creating a massive blockchain ecosystem with the goal of providing grand solutions by connecting digital assets with real assets, starting with real estate.
{% endhint %}

NFT-Proland is developing a next-generation blockchain-based ecosystem that will use blockchain technology to solve real-world problems. NFT-Proland is a platform that offers special Tokens for the purchase of real estate-based digital assets.

The NPL Token is a BEP-20-based token whose value is determined by using real estate valuation as the benchmark. As a result, the NPL Token has an intrinsic value that is self-sufficient of the real estate valuation value. NFTs that will be offered as real estate-based digital assets will use ERC-1155 to allow for fractional exchange and transfer.

BEP-20 is a BNB Smart Chain (BSC) token standard that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. Consider it a large plan for tokens that specifies how to spend them, who can spend them, and other rules for their use. The ERC-1155 token standard allows for the efficient transfer of fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single transaction.

By inviting local and global communities, NFT-Proland introduces real estate asset-based NFT trading. NFT-Proland engages attractive game and prize methods, allowing crypto players who are already widely dispersed to gradually become familiar with NFT.

NFT-Proland was formed specifically in Q3 2022 under the umbrella of Xhyre, a digital platform company formed in 2019 and registered on July 21, 2021 with the following details:
