# Staking Platform

We'll create a platform with a staking mechanism that will reward stake holders with NPL and its derivative tokens. In addition to aiming to reduce NPL circulation, staking can enable users of the utility we developed above to unlock rewards and/or generate NPLs. (The staking platform we're referring to is a lot like sites like Pancakeswap, Apeswap, etc.)
