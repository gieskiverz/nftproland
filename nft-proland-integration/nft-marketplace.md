# NFT Marketplace

NFT-Proland will offer a platform for the trading and display of NFTs. The NFT marketplace is a marketplace or NFT site that works similarly to Amazon or eBay in that it allows users to sell or buy a variety of goods, but it primarily sells NFT products.

To represent ownership of a special asset or item, whether tangible (physical) or intangible, the NFT marketplace enables digital collectors to trade and create their own NFT tokens.
