Nowadays, technological advancements can frequently satisfy human needs. Nothing more than the blockchain technology it brings with it has the potential to change the future. Blockchain technology simplifies our lives. Not only do we interact, transact, and go about our daily lives.

We believe that Blockchain technology will usher in a new era. "NFT-Proland" is here to alter the way we live our lives.

NFT-Proland is a subsidiary of Xhyre, where its headquarters are located at Level 18, 40 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, England E14 5NR. NFT-Proland created the NPL Token, which has a limited supply of only 15,000,000 and that can be exchanged, transferred, and used to buy real estate-based digital assets. NPL Token is created in the BEP-20 network due to its high speed and low density, which results in low gas fees.

The NPL Token is a forerunner to the formation of a blockchain ecosystem and network with a real asset base, with the goal of creating a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of real estate in the future.
