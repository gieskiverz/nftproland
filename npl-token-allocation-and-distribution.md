In the Pre-Sale, only 5,250,000 NPL Tokens will be available. The Pre-Sale will run from December 2022 to February 2022, or until the token supply is sold.

The Public Sale occurs after the supply in the Pre-Sale stage has been exceeded or after the Pre-Sale stage has been completed for 30 days. During the Public Sale stage, we will distribute tokens through PancakeSwap. We will give hourly rewards worth 3% of the total volume of buying and selling transactions that apply at that hour to anyone who buys NPL Tokens at this stage. The award is in the form of BUSD, which will be automatically transferred to the recipient's Wallet.
