In the Private & Pre-Sale, only 1,500,000 NPL Tokens will be available. The Private & Pre-Sale will run from December 2022 to February 2022, or until the token supply is sold.

During the Pre-Sale period, the developer will pay commissions directly to anyone who can invite their community to purchase NPL Tokens. The commission is calculated as a percentage of the total token purchases made by the community. The commission will be paid in US dollars.

NPL Tokens will be distributed in three stages during the Pre-sale stage, with 30% distributed on D-1 before the start of the Public Sale on PancakeSwap, 30% distributed +30 days after the start of the Public Sale, and 40% distributed +60 days after the start of the Public Sale.

<summary>Public Sale</summary>

The Public Sale occurs after the supply in the Pre-Sale stage has been exceeded or after the Pre-Sale stage has been completed for 30 days. During the Public Sale stage, we will distribute tokens through PancakeSwap. We will give hourly rewards worth 2% of the total volume of buying and selling transactions that apply at that hour to anyone who buys NPL Tokens at this stage. The award is in the form of BUSD, which will be automatically transferred to the recipient's Wallet.
