We believe that blockchain technology is at the epicentre of solutions capable of transforming global industries on a mass scale and in a sustainable manner, including the real estate industry. “NFT-Proland” is the #1 Blockchain-based Game Changer for Real Estate Solution

With the growing number of crypto users and players in Indonesia, we see this as a good foundation for developing NPL Tokens.

NFT-Proland is a subsidiary of Xhyre, where its headquarters are located at Level 18, 40 Bank Street, Canary Wharf, London, England E14 5NR. NFT-Proland created the NPL Token, which has a limited supply of only 15,000,000 and that can be exchanged, transferred, and used to buy real estate-based digital assets. NPL Token is created in the BEP-20 network due to its high speed and low density, which results in low gas fees.

The NPL Token is a forerunner to the formation of a blockchain ecosystem and network with a real asset base, with the goal of creating a cryptocurrency pegged to the value of real estate in the future.
